Are you a student or are you working?
I'm currently a senior at Hanoi University, which is one of the top schools in the nation. Admission is incredibly competitive so I'm very proud of being a student here.
What are you studying?
Well, I'm majoring in Accountancy, so as you can guess, I deal a lot with numbers and figures day in, day out. I can be overwhelming at times, but I'd like to think that I have a knack for mathematics and calculations so it's okay.
What's the most difficult part of your study?
Well, for the most part, I'd say it's the workload. I mean there are so many assignments and students are always under a lot of pressure from deadlines. But on the other hand, exams are a piece of cake. They are quite predictable, and I can breeze through them with a bit of revision.
What do you like most about your school?
I guess the aspect I find most enjoyable is the environment I mean I get to study English-speaking classrooms and the facilities are top-notch I mean, all the classrooms are air-conditioned and equipped with projectors. My friends and teachers are all very nice as well, so, all in all, it's a great place to study.
Are you a student or are you working?
Well, for the past couple of years, I've been working as an auditor at KMPG, which is among the top 4 auditing firms in VietNam. I love my job, and I think it's a very interesting line of work.
What do you like about your job?
Well, I guess the thing I like most about my job is the salary. I make what I'd consider a lucrative income, which means not only is it enough to cover my bills but there's also some extra to spend on whatever I want. So on payday, I often treat myself to a meal at a high-end restaurant or splurge on a nice shirt.
What do you dislike about your job?
You know, I'd have to say the overwhelming workload is something I am not a fan of. I mean, I've got a very hectic schedule, which means I'm always up to my ears in deadlines. That leaves me with very little quality time for family and friends. In the future, I might look into another job that is a bit less stressful.
What do you like after work?
Well, when we get off work, my colleagues and I usually hit the bar and grab a couple of drinks and maybe a bite to eat if we're feeling up to it. It's great fun, and a fantastic way to unwind.
