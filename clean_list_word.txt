Do you want this and if you can remember back to 1984 before laser printers, it was pretty startling to see that people went

8. 11
All we have to do is hold this up go
57
Just awesome technology in the box and i remember seeing the first uh, printout come out of it and just picking it up and looking at it thing, you know, we can sell this because you don't have to know anything about what's in that box

7. 56
We had apple talk in there

7. 50
We had a very wonderful printer controller that we designed we had adobe's postscript software in there

7. 44
We had the first canon laser printing cheap laser printing engine in the world in the united states here at apple

7. 38
We built the world's first small laser printers, you know, and there was awesome technology in that box

7. 35
I, remember with the laser writer
19
Where can we take the customer not not starting with let's sit down with the engineers and figure out what awesome technology we have and then how we're going to market that and i think that's the right path to take
01
You can't start with the technology and try to figure out where you're going to try to sell it and as we have tried to come up with a strategy and a vision for apple it started with what incredible benefits can we give to the customer
50
One of the things i've always found is that you've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology

6. 40
So in a thousand and one little and sometimes larger ways the vision needs to be reiterated i do that a lot

6. 38
It's not just a mirage out there
01
Well, that's an incredible feeling to know that you had something to do with it a and b to know it can be done to know that you can plant something in the world and it'll grow and and change the world ever so slightly there needs to be someone who is sort of the keeper and reiterator of the vision because there's just a ton of work to do and a lot of times, you know, when you have to walk a thousand miles and you take the first step, it looks like a long ways and it really helps if there's someone there saying well, we're one step closer, you know, the goal definitely exists
50
Well and focusing's hard because focusing doesn't mean saying yes, it means saying no so we say we decide not to do a lot of things so we can focus on a few handfuls of things and do them
35
So we just try to allow people to do the best work of their lives, you know, we try to hire really smart people but we have a very simple organization and we try to focus and do very few things
27
They want to be excited about what they're working on and and they want to be recognized for it when if they do a really great job
22
So one person can't do it. 
5. 24
Everybody working the company wants to do something great
13
It's really always a team you have to have an extraordinary team because these are these are um, you're trying to climb a mount with a whole party of people a lot of stuff to bring up the mountain
00
Well, you know with the beatles when they were together, uh, they did truly brilliant innovative work and when they split up they did good work, but it was it it was never the same and i i see business that way too
55
Um, and we've got that at apple as well. 
4. 58
And so that's that's what lets me do this

4. 50
They're done by they're done by a team of people and and we've got that here at pixar
29
My model of business is the beatles, you know, they were four very talented guys who who kept each other's kind of negative tendencies in check, uh, they balanced each other and and and the sum was greater than the the total was greater than the sum of the parts and that's how i see business, you know, great great things in business are never done by one person
So i consider the most important job of someone like myself is recruiting
