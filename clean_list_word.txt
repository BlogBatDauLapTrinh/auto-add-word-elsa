 She's too good to be true
(One, two, three, four)
But three days later went 'round to see her
But she was with another guy and I said, Fine
But I never asked her why
But since then loneliness has been a friend of mine
And my friend's said
(Such a pity, I'm sorry that you lost that girl)
I let her slip away
They tell me everyday
That it will be okay
Yeah, she rocks my world
More than any other girl, yeah
Dude, it's such a pity
And I'm sorry that you lost that girl
And I'm sorry that you lost that girl
One, two, three, four
Went out with the guys and before my eyes
There was this girl, she looked so fine
And she blew my mind and I wished that she was mine
And I said, Hey wait up 'cause I'm off to speak to her
And my friends said
(You'll never get her, you're never gonna get that girl)
But I didn't care
'Cause I loved her long blond hair
And love was in the air
And she looked at me
And the rest was history
Dude you're being silly 'cause you're never gonna get that girl
And you're never gonna get the girl
We spoke for hours
(She)
Took off my trousers
Spent the day laughing in the sun
We had fun and my friends they all looked stunned, yeah, yeah
Dude, she's amazing and I can't believe you've got that girl
(She's amazin', I can't believe you've got that girl)
She gave me more street cred
I dug the books she read
And how could I forget
She rocks my world
More than any other girl, yeah yeah
And I can't believe you got the girl
She looked incredible just at seventeen
I guess my friends were right, she's out of my league
So what am I to do
