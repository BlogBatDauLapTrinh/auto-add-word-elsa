Study: Ancient 16-Meter Sharks Once Roamed the Seas
Today's sharks are nothing compared to their ancient cousins.
A giant shark that roamed the oceans millions of years ago could have eaten a creature the size of a killer whale in just five bites, new research suggests.
In a study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers used fossil evidence to create a 3D model of the megalodon — one of the biggest fish of all time — and find clues about its life.
At around 16 meters from nose to tail, the megalodon was bigger than a school bus, according to the study. That's about two to three times the size of today's great white shark.
Based on their digital model, researchers calculated that the megalodon would have weighed around 70 tons, or as much as 10 elephants.
The megalodon — which lived an estimated 23 million to 2.6 million years ago — was also a strong swimmer: its average speed was faster than sharks today and it could have easily migrated across multiple oceans.
It's been difficult for scientists to get a clear picture of the megalodon, said study author Catalina Pimiento.
The megalodon's skeleton is made of soft cartilage that doesn't fossilize well, Pimiento said.
So the scientists examined what few fossils are available, including a rare collection of bones that's been at a museum in Belgium since the 1860s. Researchers also studied a jaw's worth of megalodon teeth — each one as big as a human fist.
Since megalodon fossils are rare, these kinds of models require a "leap of imagination," said Michael Gottfried, a paleontologist at Michigan State University. However, he said the study's findings are reasonable based on what is known about the giant shark.
